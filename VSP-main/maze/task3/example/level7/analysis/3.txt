<Analysis>
- First, we focus on the difference of the maze shape betweeen the candidates and the input image.
- We begin by examining the input image. It is a 7-by-7 maze. We then review the candidates.
- Candidate A is a 7-by-7 maze. Candidate B is a 6-by-6 maze. Candidate C is a 8-by-8 maze. Candidate D is a 7-by-7 maze. Therefore, Candidate B and C cannot be correct. Now we only need to choose from Candidate A and D.
- For the remaining candidates, we compare the positions of the players, goals, and the holes in the maze.
- We first check the input image. What is the position of the player in the image? The player is in row 2, column 2. We then check the remaining candidates. For Candidate D, the textual representation indicates the player is also at row 2, column 2, matching the input image. For Candidate A, the player is located at row 4, column 4. Hence, Candidate A is not the correct answer.
<Answer> D
