The player is at row 1, and the goal is at row 1. The player is neither above nor below the goal.
The player is at column 6, and the goal is at column 2. Remember that column number is counted from left to right. Comparing player (column=6) with goal (column=2), goal is counted first, meaning goal is to the left. Therefore, the player is to the right of the goal.
