As a professional navigation agent, your task is to analyze a map and determine the time needed for the car and the person passing the goal.

## Game Setup
- The game presents a fully observable map. There is a person, a car, and a goal on the map.
- The game further specifies the moving direction of the person and car ("up", "down", "left", "right").
- Your goal is to determine the time needed for the car and the person passing the goal.
The following figure shows how the player, the car, and the goals look like.

We provide an example to further illustrate the rules.

The car is moving left with speed 1.0 grid per second, and the person is moving up with speed 0.5 grid per second.

In this provided example:
- The car is 2 grid away from the goal. Given it's time as 1.0 grid per second, the time needed is 2 / 1.0 = 2 seconds.
- The person is 1 grid away from the goal. Given it's time as 0.5 grid per second, the time needed is 1 / 0.5 = 2 seconds.

## Procedure and Output
Now you will answer for the following given map. To solve it, analyze the car and the person separately. Then, answer for them separately. For example:
Car: 2.0
Person: 2.0
means car and the person will need 2.0 seconds to pass the goal respectively.
Do not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.

Please analyze and determine the time needed for the car and the person passing the goal:
